    * PHP (e.g., 8.0+)
    * Composer
    * Node.js (LTS version)
    * NPM or Yarn
    * MySQL / PostgreSQL (or any other database system you use)
    * Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/FryenX/mertha-rental.git](https://github.com/FryenX/mertha-rental.git)

    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (if applicable):**
    * Install PHP dependencies:
        ```bash
        composer install
        ```
    * Copy the example environment file and configure it:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
        Open `.env` and configure your database connection and other environment variables.
    * Generate application key:
        ```bash
        php artisan key:generate
        ```
    * Run database migrations:
        ```bash
        php artisan migrate
        ```
    * (Optional) Seed the database with dummy data:
        ```bash
        php artisan db:seed
        ```
    * Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        php artisan serve
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup (if applicable):**
    * Navigate to the frontend directory (if separate, e.g., `cd frontend`):
        ```bash
        npm install # or yarn install
        ```
    * Build the frontend assets:
        ```bash
        npm run dev # or npm run build for production
        ```
    * Start the frontend development server (if applicable, e.g., for React/Vue):
